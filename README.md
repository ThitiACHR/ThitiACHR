I am interested in plasma fusion, especially the Low-Intermediate-High confinement state transition dynamic (L-I-H transition). Right now, I am a master's student, and my research topic focuses on the interaction between turbulence, zonal flow, and mean flow during the L-I-H transition, in which the ideas to describe this phenomenon are bifurcation and predator-prey concepts. My research work is done by using the BOUT++ fluid simulation framework. Contact me via thiti.achr@gmail.com
