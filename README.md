- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThitiACHR
- 👀 I’m interested in plasma physics and controlled nuclear fusion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the predator-prey model to describe limit-cycle oscillation dureing L-H transition in magnetized plasma by using BOUT++ simulation framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on BOUT++.
